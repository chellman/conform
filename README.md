Conform
=======

## App Store description

Conform is an interactive composition for iPad, where complexity leads to less control.

You are presented with a normal 8-channel 16-step sequencer. But once you select a step, triggering it will move it to a new position. Additional function buttons modify the step grid further, enabling new creative processes.
